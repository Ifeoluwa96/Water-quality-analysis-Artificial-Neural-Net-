# Water-quality-analysis-Artificial-Neural-Net-
This component uses CEFASâ€™ 2021 data on biotoxins and phytoplantkon (see https://
www.cefas.co.uk/data-and-publications/habs/england-and-wales-biotoxins-and-
phytoplankton-results-2021/) to find patterns of  higher or lower concentration of  either (or 
both) according to features provided. The data was read into a program (second tab on 
phytoplankton), cleaned and then train a multi-layer feed-forward neural network to predict 
from a set of  input features whether the phytoplankton level detected is above the threshold 
specified.
